About
-----

This is a little bash program I wrote to change the title in the metadata of a 
PDF document. It provides a GUI and can therefore be integrated in graphical 
environments (e.g. file browsers). It should run on any Linux box.


Usage
-----

Simply start pdftitle, and a file chooser dialog will be presented. Start it 
with a PDF file as argument, and this PDF will be modified. Most errors will be 
reported in a graphical manner in addition to the console output.


Dependencies
------------

Pdftitle is implemented as bash script and uses various software to perform its 
task. Here is a list of software which must be installed:

- zenity (For the GUI)
- pdftk  (For PDF manipulation)

In addition, some commands are used which are normally installed on a linux 
system, e.g. 'grep' and 'file'.
