About
-----

This is a little program I wrote to change the title in the metadata of a PDF 
document. It provides a GUI and can therefore be integrated in graphical 
environments (e.g. file browsers).


Usage
-----

Simply start pdftitle, and a file chooser dialog will be presented. Start it 
with a PDF file as argument, and this PDF will be modified.  Any errors will 
be reported in a graphical manner AND to the console.
